<H4>Acknowledgement</H4>

<p> With sincere gratitude, I would like to thank professor Christa Rampley, Department of English at the University of Georgia, for her help in the making of this dictionary, as well as for her enlightening lectures from which I have benefited a great deal. Without her invaluable inspiration and counsel, this dictionary would not be what it currently is. </p>

<p>My heartfelt thanks also goes to Ann Gillespie, my tutor, who with extraordinary patience and consistent encouragement gave me much help by providing me with necessary materials, advice of great value, and inspiration for new ideas.  Her insights drew my attention to a number of deficiencies within this text and made many things clearer.</p>

<p>Also, I am pleased to acknowledge my classmate Yutong, who is also one of my best friends here at UGA, for her earnest assistance throughout the preparation of the original manuscript. She graciously made sound comments on and suggestions for the outline of this dictionary.</p>

<p>In addition, I am extremely grateful for my roommates, Cassie and Mai, for their cooperation, comments, and wise advice.  Although their advice was not always taken, I enjoyed our intense discussions very much.</p>
<H4>Preface</H4>

             

<p>This is a dictionary of special words and phrases of Chinese slang for readers who are in a state of confusion regarding translating between Chinese and English. In our daily conversations, regardless of the language we speak, there are always many pet phrases and buzzwords. The usage of these words becomes an important part of people's lives because without these specific phrases, it can be difficult to convey information and to be understood. Slang words and phrases have established meanings in popular culture and contemporary life, making daily communication much easier.</p>

<p>To study a second language, understanding and using slang correctly can be a very difficult challenge. As for a second language learner, I totally understand the feeling when you cannot get your friends’ point from daily conversations. I struggled with this for a long time and realized people who are learning Chinese as the second language would have the same kinds of concerns and problems as I do. Finally, I decided to write a collection of Chinese slang as the content of this dictionary. As a kind of "Treasure Hill", this dictionary could fill the gap between you and the native speakers. With the help of these internet buzzwords, by concentrated studying for a time period, you might become an "Alive Wikipedia " in your social circle.</p> 

<p>Convenient for international travelers, this dictionary could save you in emergency circumstances and embarrassing situations. For instance, when you are trying to make a joke with the friends you meet in China but find yourself struggling to find the appropriate words, you could easily search our eBook ”Chinese Slang” online within seconds. As a relatively grounded tool, it would help you with all of the concerns you have about Chinese slang. After reading the entire dictionary, I am sure that you will be the best Chinese-speaking foreigner people around you in China have ever seen.</p>

<p>However, this dictionary is not just for those whose native language is not Chinese.  On the contrary, native speakers will find much interest in this manual. In our daily conversations, it is not out of the ordinary to forget how to use a phrase correctly. Moreover, you could use this as a tool to learn about the history of the Chinese language.</p>

<p>To sum up, "Crack the prevalent passwords of Chinese Slang--a collection of internet buzzwords and daily pet phrases" would be the best dictionary ever for people with or without fundamental knowledge </p>
